@book{Griffiths2017,
  abstract  = {Developed by recognized experts in the field, this first-of-its-kind resource introduces the basic principles of passive radar technology and provides an overview of recent developments in this field and existing real passive radar systems. This book explains how passive radar works, how it differs from the active type, and demonstrates the benefits and drawbacks of this novel technology. Properties of illuminators, including ambiguity functions, digital vs. analog, digitally-coded waveforms, vertical-plane coverage, and satellite-borne and radar illuminators are explored. Readers find practical guidance on direct signal suppression, passive radar performance prediction, and detection and tracking. This book provides concrete examples of systems and results, including analog TV, FM radio, cell phone base stations, DVB–T and DAB, HF skywave transmissions, indoor WiFi, satellite-borne illuminators, and low-cost scientific remote sensing. Future developments and applications of passive r},

@book{Malanowski2019,
  abstract  = {This cutting-edge resource introduces the basic concepts of passive bistatic radar, such as bistatic geometry, bistatic radar equation and analysis of different illuminating signals. These techniques, although known for almost a century, have not been developed intensively for decades, mainly due to technical limitations, but today, the passive radar concept can be realized in practice, and is of great interest for military and civilian users. This book provides insight into understanding the potential and limitations of passive radar systems, as well as the differences between signal processing in active and passive radar. Each of the signal processing stages typically applied in passive radar is described, including digital beamforming, clutter removal, target detection, localization and tracking. These concepts are illustrated with both simulated and measured data along with examples of passive radar systems. Correlation processing, which is crucial for passive radar operation, is },
